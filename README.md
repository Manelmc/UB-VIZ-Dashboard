# UB Visualisation Dashboard
Dashboard task repository for the Visualisation subject from the Data Science Master in the UB.

## Concept
Applying the cereals dataset information, the Dashboard is divided into 4 sections also partitioned in 4 subsections. Except for the form (user's feedback). In the three additional sections we have, one section about the brands, another about health, and a last one regarding cereals.

## Ideas
- **Brand section** could show a historic of the cereals sold by each brand. Maybe pointing out which ones are still available (Problem: No info about year in the dataset)
