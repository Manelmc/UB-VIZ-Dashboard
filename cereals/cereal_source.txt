BREAKFAST CEREAL DATA 

Develop a dashboard that would allow the consumer
to quickly compare a particular cereal to other possible choices. Some
additional questions to consider:

    * Are there any cereals which are virtually identical?
    * Is there any way to discriminate among the major manufacturers by
      cereal characteristics, or do they each have a "balanced
      portfolio" of cereals?
    * Do the nutritional claims made in cereal advertisements stand the
      scrutiny of data analysis?
    * Are there cereals which are clearly nutritionally superior, or
      inferior? Are there clusters of cereals?
    * Is a ranking or scoring scheme possible or reasonable, and if so,
      are there cereals which are nutritionally superior or inferior
      under all reasonable weighting schemes? 

The variables of the dataset are listed below, in order. For
convenience, we suggest that you use the variable name supplied in
square brackets.
